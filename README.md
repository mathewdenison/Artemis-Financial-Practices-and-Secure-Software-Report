# Artemis-Financial-Practices-and-Secure-Software-Report

Brief description of client and issues that were addressed

  The client, Artemis Financial, is looking to implement the most secure and effective software security protocols. They are looking for our company, Global Rain, to take steps to protect their confidential client financial data. The way they want to do this is to add a verification that the communication is secure when transferring data with a checksum. 
  
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

  I believe that I identified a secure cypher to encrypt the data (SHA-256) and verified it through checksum on the localhost server. This ensure that the one way communication between client and server side was not able to be broken. It is extremely important to code securely so that data is protected, and that access to the server is validated and confirmed. This provides highest levels of trust between the organization and the customers, ensuring that their data is safe from any potential hacks. This will in turn make sure that the company makes more money due to public perception. 
  
What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

  The thing I thought was most difficult with the vulnerability assessment was how to set it up, where to add the plugin, and how to make sure that the Maven build was run correctly. The portion that was most helpful was determining the actual vulnerabilities and researching whether they were false positives or not.
  
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques? How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


  The ways that I approached the need to increase security layers ways to write code that was executed more efficiently, and confirming that the private and public setters and getters were implemented correctly. Overall I would make sure that I start with some of the secure coding practices I learned in this course, and then run the vulnerability report to make sure that it is even more secure. I can then learn more and more what I need to do to write secure and efficient code. Overall the combination of the testing of code and running through the vulnerability report taught me better how to write secure code from the beginning which allows me to static test more effectively in the future.
  

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  Tools that I used were the vulnerability tests, SHA-256 encryption and checksum to validate communication, and HTTPS.
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

  My ability to write effective and secure code when communicating between server and client. Usage of modern technologies and cyphers to validate that my code is indeed secure.
